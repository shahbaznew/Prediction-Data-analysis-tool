# Projects2

The aim of this project is to develop a data analysis system whcih investigates or predicts occurrences of solarflares for the different classes of type C,M and X. 
This tool uses the dateset linked as data to predict the next occurences and what class the solarflares are. This uses sunspots responsible for thier occureneces. 

The code consists of training the AI from the dataset and testing stages to give the correct outcomes required. Also it uses the data to predict furture occruences to minimise solar radiation effects on ground development and GPS, CMR(Coronal mass ejections). From successful training and testing stages the AI now can evolve uses different datasets or multiple to predict more accurately.
